One day a king had a dream where he was surrounded by three huge rocks. He tried to push them , climb them over but nothing worked. When he fell down after exhausting his energy he  heard some sound comes three rocks. On focussing he heard them repeating three questions over and over again.
Once the king was awake those three quesions started burning his heart.
